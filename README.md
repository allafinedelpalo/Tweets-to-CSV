# Tweets in CSV with python

This small project has been made to collect tweets using  
Twitter API and then store them ina CSV file.  


### Without a Makefile
To initialize the project, create a virtual environment  
with virtualenv. I have named mine 'python-twitter'.  
```
virtualenv python-twitter
```

Now, activate the virtual environment:  
```
source ./python-twitter/bin/activate
```

Then install the required modules:  
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
